## Description

This was a team Epicodus project that showcases our knowledge of intermediate Javascript. We put together a working webpack development environment for programming this project. This Pokedex application will allow a user to search by a number of different filters on the kind of pokemon they would like to view. Another option is the user could simply put the index number or name of pokemon of their choice in the search form. Lastly, there is also an option to compare two cards side by side.
